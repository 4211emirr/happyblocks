# HappyBlocks
HappyBlocks is an open-source game developed purely out of boredom. It is far from perfect and, frankly, filled with bugs. Think of them as "surprise features" rather than issues.

# What is HappyBlocks?
This is a simple, open-source project created for fun. It’s not a polished masterpiece, but it’s a great place to explore messy code and chaotic gameplay.

# How to Play
The game supports two players on the same keyboard:

Player 1: Controlled with W, A, S, D.

Player 2: Controlled with Arrow Keys.

The best way to learn is by playing. Explore the glitches and enjoy the chaos!

Contribution
Since this project is open-source and bug-heavy, feel free to fork it, fix something, or break it even more. Pull requests are always welcome.
